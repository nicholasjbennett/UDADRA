	@description = Hellfire-in-a-box - water is a great solvent - even more so at high temperature, under pressure, with added oxygen. Throw in organics and out comes sterile water, CO2, nitrogen, & 'ash' (everything else). The hard part is stopping it eating it's way out of the box. This unit will convert the non gas wastes of one Kerbal over a day. Also contains <i>Soylent Starter</i>; required for healthy algal growth, one unit is good for about 3,000 Kerbal days (don't ask what's in it, if we told you we'd have to kill you).
